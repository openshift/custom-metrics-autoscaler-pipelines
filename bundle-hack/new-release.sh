# 1. Go through the list of all the releases in the CMA 
# 2. Find the most recent one (or take one from the CLI if we're doing a point release) 
# 3. Add an entry in the release template for it (maybe increment by 1 if we're actually releasing it)  
# 4. generate the fbc catalog from it
# 5. The build will handle the rest of it 
#     -- we might be able to do 3/4 in the build itself but I'm worried about the pull secret because it needs to retireve stuff
